### Why use scikit-learn with machine learning?
* Open Source
* Large number of ML algorithms
* Works with other Python libraries

### Supervised Learning
Feature: measurable property
Target: what you want to predict

Models that learn the relationship between features and targets can make predictions for future data or unseen data

Supervised learning works best for:
* Predict a continuous value (regression)
* Predict a categorical value (classification)

In supervised learning an algorithm learns from an existing set of feature data (most commonly a matrix) and target data (most commonly a vector) to make predictions

### Formatting data with scikit-learn
Scikit learn expects a 2d grid of data where each row is a sample, and the columns represent specific features or categories of the samples

Target vectors are usually one-dimensional, this represents the information you are trying to predict.
